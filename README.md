# Mue - Your Custom Playlist, Offline!
A personal project of mine to explore front end development(?). Clone it to get your own freeee copy!! :)

### Take note though:
1) You **have** to download your music online and move all of the files to the `music_here` folder in the container folder. Only then can you use the music files on the website (provided if you selected them in the `music_here` folder).

2) Online fonts used are probably unavailable if you are offline so the interface looks kinda weird.

3) I don't know what else to say

Anyway, Mue is something like the VLC Media Player except it runs on browsers and has ~~stunning~~ ~~gorgeous~~ good UI(?). ._.

Everything is made and owned by me, otherwise stated in creds.txt. :)

Don't you dare plagiarize :)
